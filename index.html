<P>1. Lay out a rectangular piece of paper. If you are using patterned or printed paper, begin with the decorated side facing up so it will show on the outside of the boat
    2.Fold the sheet of paper in half from top to bottom to create a horizontal crease in the middle â€“ the non-patterned side of your paper should now be visible
    3.Fold the top corners in towards the middle so that they meet. Leave 1-2 inches of space at the bottom. You should now have a triangle shape
    4.Fold the flaps at the bottom of the triangle shape up on both sides
    5.Pop out the middle to make a hat shape
    6.Using your fingers, open the hat shape out even more until it forms a square. Tuck the corners of one flap under the other
    7.Fold up the bottom flaps of the square on both sides so you are left with a triangle shape
    8.Pull out the middle of the triangle to form a square
    9.Pull out the middle of the square
    10.Press the shape flat
    11.Open out from the bottom to assemble your boat shape
    12.Ta-da! now finally your work is completed !!</P>
